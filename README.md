# Python Tutorials

**IN DEVELOPMENT**

## About
This is a python program developed by Isaiah Carrington, to teach about basic python concepts, and provide a testing platform where user's can get their knowledge tested.

## How it works
I (Isaiah) have designed the script such that it requires no external packages/modules. To run it, simply download the python file from above, and run it. NOTE: **THIS IS STILL IN DEVELOPMENT**.
After development is complete, or reaches a satisfactory state, then I will release an exe version for all users that may not have python installed.

## Overview
As previously mentioned, the main purpose of this script is to provide easily digestible notes, along with an area where students will get tested on said notes. The aim of this script, is so that users should have a good understanding of the fundamentals of Python.
Enough so as to actually get started on little projects of their own
